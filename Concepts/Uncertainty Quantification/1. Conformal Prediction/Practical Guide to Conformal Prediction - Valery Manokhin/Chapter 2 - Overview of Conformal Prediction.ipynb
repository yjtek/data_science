    "- Conformal prediction deals with quantifying uncertainty\n",

    "- There are 2 types of uncertainty:\n",
    "    - Aleatoric uncertainty: Aleatoric uncertainty arises from the randomness and inherent unpredictability of the system being studied\n",
    "        - Rolling a dice: you know the probability of each side, but you can't predict outcome with certainty\n",
    "        - Weather forecasting: Inherent randomness in weather processes, although I'd probably say this is a mix of epistemic uncertainty too\n",
    "        - Stock market fluctuations: Probably both aleatoric and epistemic\n",
    "        - Traffic flow: Probably both aleatoric and epistemic\n",
    "    - Epistemic uncertainty: Epistemic uncertainty arises from our lack of knowledge about the system\n",
    "        - Medical diagnosis: Even with perfect knowledge of patient's state, you may not know enough about the disease\n",
    "        - Financial forecasting\n",
    "        - Natural disaster prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want a shorthand for this;\n",
    "    - Aleatoric uncertainty is when you have data, but the variance is super high so you can't model well\n",
    "    - Epistemic uncertainty is when you have no data"
